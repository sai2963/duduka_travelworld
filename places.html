                            <p>Jaipur is the capital of the royal state of Rajasthan and is also known as the Pink
                                City. It is one of the most famous tourist circuits in India and is part of the Golden
                                Triangle along with Delhi and Agra1. Jaipur was established by Jai Singh II, the Raja of
                                Amber, in 1727 when he shifted his capital from Amber to the new city because of the
                                rapidly-growing population and an increasing water scarcity2. The city is renowned
                                globally for its coloured gems and combines the allure of its ancient history with all
                                the advantages of a metropolis2. The bustling modern city is one of the three corners of
                                the golden triangle that includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur2. The story goes that in 1876,
                                the Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the colour pink was symbolic of
                                hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire city pink. </p>
